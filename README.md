# React text selection handler

Library used to handle text selections. Selected text will return with contents, and rectangles for the region selected.

## Demo

You can see how the library works by running

```
yarn build-test-app
```

This will build the app in `/e2e/build_test_app/index.htm`. This file will open a page with a basic usage of this library. You can also check `/e2e/test_app/src/App.tsx` for an example of how to implement the library.
